# pjarcher913/portfolio-api

 Full-stack Golang/React project that serves my portfolio website with an underlying API.
 The API is entirely composed of Easter eggs...different requests will do different things.
 See [this link](#) for more information on the API.
 
 Because everything was built on-top of a Golang backend, the program (once compiled and built) is ran entirely from a
 single executable file. Everything in `~\src\` must be compiled for the build to succeed.
